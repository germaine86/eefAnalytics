\title{Bayesian analysis of Cluster Randomised Education Trials (CRT) using Vague Priors.}
\usage{
crtBayes(formula, random, intervention, nsim = 10000, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The model to be analysed. It should be of the form y ~ x1 + x2 + ..., where y is the outcome variable and Xs are the predictors.}

\item{random}{A string specifying the "clustering variable" (e.g., schools or sites) as found in the dataset.}

\item{intervention}{A string specifying the "intervention variable" as it appears in the formula.}

\item{nsim}{Number of MCMC iterations to be performed. A minimum of 10,000 is recommended to ensure convergence.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables referenced in the formula, including predictors, the clustering variable, and the intervention.}
}
\value{
S3 object; a list consisting of:
\itemize{
\item \code{Beta}: Estimates and credible intervals for the predictors specified in the model (posterior distributions).
\item \code{ES}: Hedges' g effect size for the intervention(s). If bootstrapping is not used, 95\% credible intervals are computed based on MCMC sampling.
\item \code{covParm}: Variance components broken down into between-cluster variance (e.g., between schools), within-cluster variance (e.g., within pupils), and intra-cluster correlation (ICC)..
\item \code{ProbES}: A matrix showing the probability of observing an effect size larger than various thresholds (0, 0.05, 0.10, ...).
\item \code{Unconditional}: A list containing the unconditional effect size and variance decomposition.
}
}
\description{
\code{crtBayes} performs Bayesian multilevel analysis of cluster randomised education trials, utilising vague priors
and JAGS language to fit the model. It assumes hierarchical clustering, such as students within schools, and estimates
treatment effects while accounting for this structure.
}
\details{
The function provides posterior estimates for fixed effects (predictors) and random effects (clustering) under a Bayesian framework.
Effect sizes are computed using Hedges' g, and variance components are decomposed into between-cluster and within-cluster variances.
